            <h3>History of Chittagong:</h3>
            <p class="history">The region of Chittagong is traditionally centred around its seaport which has existed
                since ancient
                times. The region was home to the ancient independent Buddhist kingdoms of Samatata and Harikela. It
                later fell under of the rule of the Gupta Empire, the Pala Empire and the Arakanese kingdom of Waithali
                until the 7th century. Arab Muslims traded with the port from as early as the 9th century. Historian
                Lama Taranath is of the view that the Buddhist king Gopichandra had his capital at Chittagong in the
                10th century. According to Tibetan tradition, this century marked the birth of Tantric Buddhism in the
                region. The region has been explored by numerous historic travellers, most notably Ibn Battuta of
                Morocco who visited in the 14th century. During this time, the region was conquered and incorporated
                into the independent Sonargaon Sultanate by Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah in 1340 AD. Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam
                Shah constructed a highway from Chittagong to Chandpur and ordered the construction of many lavish
                mosques and tombs. After the defeat of the Sultan of Bengal Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah in the hands of Sher
                Shah Suri in 1538, the Arakanese Kingdom of Mrauk U managed to regain Chittagong. From this time onward,
                until its conquest by the Mughal Empire, the region was under the control of the Portuguese and the Magh
                pirates (a notorious name for Arakanese) for 128 years.

                The Mughal commander Shaista Khan, his son Buzurg Umed Khan, and Farhad Khan, expelled the Arakanese
                from the area during the Conquest of Chittagong in 1666 and established Mughal rule there. After the
                Arakanese expulsion, Islamabad, as the area came to be known, made great strides in economic progress.
                This can mainly be attributed to an efficient system of land-grants to selected diwans or faujdars to
                clear massive areas of hinterland and start cultivation. The Mughals, similar to the Afghans who came
                earlier, also built mosques having a rich contribution to the architecture in the area. What is called
                Chittagong today also began to have improved connections with the rest of Mughal Bengal. The city was
                occupied by Burmese troops shortly in First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824 and the British increasingly grew
                active in the region and it fell under the British Empire. The people of Chittagong made several
                attempts to gain independence from the British, notably on 18 November 1857 when the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
                companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment stationed at Chittagong rose in rebellion and released
                all the prisoners from jail but were suppressed by the Kuki scouts and the Sylhet Light Infantry (10th
                Gurkha Rifles).</p>
